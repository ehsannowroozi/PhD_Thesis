Abstract:
The use of machine-learning for multimedia forensics is gaining more and
more consensus, especially due to the amazing possibilities offered by
modern machine learning techniques. By exploiting deep learning tools, new
approaches have been proposed whose performance remarkably exceed those
achieved by state-of-the-art methods based on standard machine-learning and
model-based techniques. However, the inherent vulnerability and fragility of
machine learning architectures pose new serious security threats, hindering
the use of these tools in security-oriented applications, and, among them,
multimedia forensics. The analysis of the security of machine learning-based
techniques in the presence of an adversary attempting to impede the forensic
analysis, and the development of new solutions capable to improve the security
of such techniques is then of primary importance, and, recently, has marked
the birth of a new discipline, named Adversarial Machine Learning.

By focusing on Image Forensics and image manipulation detection in par-
ticular, this thesis contributes to the above mission by developing novel tech-
niques for enhancing the security of binary manipulation detectors based on
machine learning in several adversarial scenarios. The validity of the pro-
posed solutions has been assessed by considering several manipulation tasks,
ranging from the detection of double compression and contrast adjustment, to
the detection of geometric transformations and filtering operations.
